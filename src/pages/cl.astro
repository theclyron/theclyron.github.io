      <ul class="list-disc pl-5">
         <li>
            Added the <b>Changelog</b> (<code>/cl</code>) page <small>(the page you're currently looking at!)</small>, tracking version history and changes.
         </li>
         <li>
            The navbar is now an <b>Astro Component</b>, allowing for easier code maintenance. The JavaScript check has been moved inside the component as well.
         </li>
         <li>
            Removed the <b>Retro Site</b> button from homepage. An eventual Retro Frontend will be built on top of clyronwebsite instead of a separate one, for easier maintenance
         </li>
         <li>
            The <b>Visit Homepage</b> button has been removed from the 404 page. Unnecessary, as the navbar exists
         </li>
         <li>
            Updated introduction in homepage. Now specifing just Minecraft as my (Clyron's) "all-time favorite game". Also removed the <a href="/cairo">Cairo</a> line, as the OC is no longer being used. The page continues to be available though.
         </li>
         <li>
            Navbar items and webring names are now <b>bold</b>.
         </li>
         <li>
            Readjusted order in the Socials page. Geometry Dash is now last.
         </li>
         <li>
            Fixed a typo in a CSS class for the blog posts.
         </li>
      </ul>
