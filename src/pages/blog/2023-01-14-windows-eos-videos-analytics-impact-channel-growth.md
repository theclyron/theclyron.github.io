It's only mid-January and this is already the second blog post of 2023. The motivational effect of the Bulma redesign of this blog is showing. Anyways, this blog post will be focused on the main channel, mainly on the two Windows End of Support videos I've made for Windows 7 and 8.1. Speaking of Windows 7, a fun fact: the EOS was exactly three years ago today (exclucing ESU). Time sure does fly, right?

Another fun fact, on main channel Windows EOS videos generally speaking, would be that there was also a video on the Windows Vista EOS back in 2017, but which was deleted with most other videos from the time later in the year; this was a huge mistake, I advise you not to delete your older videos or entire channel from YT because you'll eventually regret your decision, unless you really know what you're doing and are completely aware of the irreversible impact. You will eventually want to watch your old videos and remember those good old times from when you were younger but then cannot because you deleted them. As for the video itself, it was just 2017 me "crying" that "my favorite Windows version ended support", having few views and being in that "Sading that" series that I made for my main channel during 2016-17 (and that name wasn't even good English; if my 2017 self had my 2023 grammar, it would've been likely named "Crying over" instead). In other words, summarizing, the video does not longer exist.

Fast-forwarding to 14 January 2020, almost three years later (and exactly three years ago!), the day of the end of support of Windows 7 came. These type of videos are opportunities that tech channels focusing on operating systems like mine get only once, and Windows 7 is one of the best Windows versions of all time. This particular video was a success, becoming the most popular video on my channel at one point (all my pre-Lynxmic videos being unlisted since I wanted to start over my channel and couldn't pass not to do so). I will explain in detail with analytics later in this blog post, since that is the point of it, right? This video currently sits at 420+ views as of writing this blog post; if you want to watch it, [click/tap here][1].

The Windows 7 EOS video was the beginning of the style of its type that the Windows 8.1 EOS video would have (a skit where the user finds out of the EOS, followed by my experience and history on the Windows version and next steps going forward, then an marathon of the best moments involving the Windows version as appearing on my channels), except that in the skit in the beginning continues after the marathon in the case of the 8.1 video. I'm looking to continue this style with the Windows 10 EOS video (if that ever comes out, who knows if I'll be still around by October 2025 or not).

## Let's talk analytics (for real this time)
With all the secondary things out of the way, the video I've made with the occasion of the EOS for Windows 8.1 has been up for 4 days now and still going strong, with over 750+ views. As stated from the title, we'll be comparing the analytics of both the Windows 7 and 8.1 EOS videos. For a better look into, screenshots are going to be used throughout the blog post. We'll also take a look into the general analytics to have knowledge of the contribution these two videos have in the growth of the main channel.

![Views of the Windows EOS videos side-by-side. Data as of 14 January 2023.](https://clyron.is-a.dev/img/blog/msedge_XatBqLaB1X.png)

As you can notice in the above screenshot, both videos had a view growth rate that was expected for the first day of them being up aka EOS day. The Windows 7 video had gained 100+ views on EOS day, while the Windows 8.1 video had gained some 340+ views on EOS day.

However, what's interesting are the analytics of the videos after the EOS dates for 7 and 8.1. The Windows 7 video had stagnated at 100+ views, with a view growth rate typical of most other videos on my channel. Meanwhile, the view growth rate of the Windows 8.1 video still doesn't have any signs of slowing 4 days later, for some reason. It's an unprecedented case in the six years of Lynxmic history. Huge thanks to everyone who watched that video!

The above screenshot shows the most popular methods through which the Windows 8.1 video gained views. The left applies to EOS day, while the right is in the last 48 hours as of date this blog post was written on. YouTube search dominates on EOS day, which was expected. A few days later, the algorithm (suggested videos + browse features) dominates. Something odd that happened today (again, as of writing this blog post) was that views from "suggested videos" began to accelerate, increasing the view growth rate as seen in the first screenshot (blue line).

The next screenshot that you're going to see now will showcase how well performed the Windows 7 video in the past year. Notice the spike at the end?

Most-if-not-all of these views came from the Windows 8.1 video, from where I linked both from the description and from the cards. Though idk why would anyone care about the analytics of the Windows 7 video in particular but thought I'd mention this. Next (and last) screenshot that I'll add in this blog post will involve the impact of the Windows 8.1 video on the main channel itself, particularly around subscriber numbers. For this I will be taking data from SocialBlade, as I think it describes the best. It's all self-explanatory, so I'll just let the screenshot speak for y'all readers of the Lynxmic Blog.

Notice the numbers for 11 January 2023 and beyond? One thing to keep in mind: as of writing this blog post, the main channel has in reality 116 subscribers. It takes some time to reflect in the analytics that aren't real-time. The last time the main channel's subscriber count has blown up following a single video getting hundreds of views was in October 2020, with that opinion video I made on Minecraft Java Edition ditching Mojang accounts in favor of Microsoft accounts, the same account system used in Bedrock ([click/tap here to watch][3]). I'd directly put in one more screenshot, this time regarding the impact of that said video in main channel growth, but I don't want to unnecessarily clutter this post, so here's the link to the [tweet I made on the matter][4]. Knowing Twitter nowadays, I'll still explain on this post what was the impact: subscriber and view growth exploding in a similar manner to the Windows 8.1 video.

Now, before I actually conclude this blog post, giving y'all a little friendly reminder that we're resuming our normal main channel video schedule starting next week, the true big return following the holidays will be on 21 January with a video I finished over a month in advance (since I couldn't pass at all), you'll see what it is about when it comes out. I also have another video that I have yet to finish editing and one more for which I'm currently recording footage, so things are on the move. The schedule will remain the same for now, look forward to <strong class="has-text-white">a new video every Saturday at 10:00 CET/11:00 EET</strong> as usual from next week onwards. Until then, you know where to find me.
