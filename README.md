# website-exp
An experimental rewrite of the clyron.is-a.dev website, using Astro (JS-based), instead of Jekyll (Ruby-based)

This is not a production-ready website, things such as the blog not having been implemented yet. Furthermore, things may be buggy and the designs currently used in the website may or may not be permanent.
